# WEB-Scraping-IMBD-in-Python
Aim is to create a python script which can be used to fetch the Ratings and Genre of the films in your films folder that match with ones on IMDb, the data is scraped from IMDB's official website and store in a csv file. The csv file can be used for analysis then, sorting according to rating etc., at later stages. 
Modules Used – 
•	Time
•	Requests
•	CSV
•	BS4.
Here we use Request module to request data from IMBD and from bs4 we use Beautiful Soup to Scrape data from web. We use CSV module after scraping data to store the data in csv file. Later on we perform tasks on csv file to analyse and sort. We use time module to name the csv file according to the time and date according to the day we use the script.
